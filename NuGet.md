This package allows you to seed the data to SQL Server database using pure SQL scripts but in a managed fashion similar to Entity Framework Core migrations.

### Invoking the seeding
Install NuGet package to your project


```
dotnet add package EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Seeding
```

Add script seeding to services collection and supply the connection string to the database

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	...
	services.AddScriptSeeding(Configuration.GetConnectionString("EmployeesDatabase"));
	...
}
```

Invoke the seeding in the pipeline by supplying the assembly where your scripts are sitting along with a folder under which scripts sit under project tree. The default value is "Seedings"

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	...
    app.SeedFromScripts(typeof(EmployeesDatabaseContext).Assembly, "Seedings");
	...
}
```

### Adding new seeding script
As a first step you need to install global tool [EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Seeding.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Seeding.Tool/) which will help you add the seeding script to the project where you want to have your seeding scripts.
I usually keep them together with migrations as a part of infrastructure.

```
dotnet tool install --global EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Seeding.Tool 
```

From a command line (cmd, PowerShell, bashâ€¦) navigate to project folder where you want your scripts to sit.
Simply add the script by invoking the previously installed global tool

```
seeding add "Add_Initial_Employees" -o Seedings
```

This will create new file under Seedings folder in your project tree.
Once you run the main project, seeding files will be executed and recorded in **__SeedingHistory** table
