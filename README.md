# SQL Server script seeding for Entity Framework Core

## Overview

Allows you to seed the data to SQL Server database using pure SQL scripts but in a managed fashion similar to Entity Framework Core migrations

## Usage
### Invoking the seeding
To use SQL script seeding with EF Core and targeting SQL Server database you need to bring in the NuGet package which contains extension methods for dependency injection and ASP.NET Core pipeline.

NOTE: For now, only .NET Core native dependency injection is supported. Hopefully if the package is popular other DI containers support will be there

```
dotnet add package EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Seeding
```

Add script seeding to services collection and supply the connection string to the database

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	...
	services.AddScriptSeeding(Configuration.GetConnectionString("EmployeesDatabase"));
	...
}
```

Invoke the seeding in the pipeline by supplying the assembly where your scripts are sitting along with a folder under which scripts sit under project tree. The default value is "Seedings"

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	...
    app.SeedFromScripts(typeof(EmployeesDatabaseContext).Assembly, "Seedings");
	...
}
```

### Adding new seeding script
As a first step you need to install global tool which will help you add the seeding script to the project where you want to have your seeding scripts.
I usually keep them together with migrations as a part of infrastructure.

```
dotnet tool install --global EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Seeding.Tool 
```

From a command line (cmd, PowerShell, bashâ€¦) navigate to project folder where you want your scripts to sit.
Simply add the script by invoking the previously installed global tool

```
seeding add "Add_Initial_Employees" -o Seedings
```

This will create new file under Seedings folder in your project tree.
Once you run the main project, seeding files will be executed and recorded in __SeedingHistory table
